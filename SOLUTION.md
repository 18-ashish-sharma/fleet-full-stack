# Solution.md

## Overview

I approached the development of the full-stack web application with a focus on simplicity, maintainability, and responsiveness. The application consists of a frontend built using a modern JavaScript framework and a backend powered by a Node.js server. The GitHub API is utilized to fetch commit and diff information.

## Frontend

### Technology Stack

- **Framework:** I chose React.js for the frontend due to its component-based architecture, which promotes code reusability and maintainability.
- **Routing:** React Router is used for handling navigation and displaying the commit page based on the provided URL.
- **Styling:** I utilized CSS-in-JS using styled-components for a clean and maintainable styling solution.
- **HTTP Requests:** Axios is used for making HTTP requests to the backend API.

### Responsiveness

The application is designed to be responsive, ensuring a consistent user experience across various devices and screen sizes.

### Implementation Details

The commit page is rendered when navigating to `http://localhost:1234/repositories/:owner/:repository/commit/:commitSHA`. It fetches commit details and the associated diff using the backend API.

## Backend

### Technology Stack

- **Framework:** Express.js is used as the backend server framework for its simplicity and flexibility.
- **GitHub API:** The GitHub API (REST or GraphQL) is employed to fetch commit and diff information.

### API Schema

The backend follows the documented API schema available at [https://teamfleetstudio.github.io/git-diff-api-doc/](https://teamfleetstudio.github.io/git-diff-api-doc/). Endpoints are designed to provide the required commit and diff data.

### Implementation Details

- The backend server handles incoming requests for commit details and diff information.
- It interacts with the GitHub API to fetch the necessary data.
- The response is then sent to the frontend for rendering.

## Known Limitations and Trade-offs

### Limitations

- **Pagination:** The current implementation does not handle paginated responses from the GitHub API. To improve, pagination support can be added.
- **Error Handling:** While basic error handling is implemented, more robust error handling and user feedback can be added.
- **Security:** Security considerations such as input validation and authentication are minimal in this solution and should be enhanced for a production-ready application.

### Trade-offs

- **Performance vs. Detail:** The application prioritizes fetching relevant data efficiently. Depending on the use case, additional optimizations may be needed for large repositories.

## Future Improvements

Given more time, I would focus on the following areas:

1. **Authentication:** Implementing user authentication to enhance security and enable features like personalized commit history.
2. **Testing:** Extensive unit and integration testing to ensure the reliability of the application.
3. **Enhanced Error Handling:** Implementing more informative error messages and handling edge cases gracefully.
4. **Pagination Support:** Adding support for paginated responses from the GitHub API for repositories with a large number of commits.

## Conclusion

This solution aims to provide a functional and responsive web application for viewing commit details and code differences. While meeting the basic requirements, there is room for improvement in terms of security, error handling, and additional features. The outlined trade-offs and future improvements provide a roadmap for enhancing the application.
